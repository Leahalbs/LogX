The version 3.1.4.0 of this program has garnered attention for its functionality, but users should exercise caution as the file may be flagged by some antivirus programs as potentially unsafe, leading to confusion regarding its legitimacy; however, it is not inherently malware or a virus, and many users report it as safe to use when downloaded from official sources. Despite its intended use, some users may encounter errors related to compatibility or performance issues, which can stem from system-specific configurations or conflicts with other software.
